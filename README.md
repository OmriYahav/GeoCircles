# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

### Configure Google Maps

This project now uses the Google Maps Platform for maps, place search, and routing. Before running the app, add your Google Maps API key to `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "config": { "googleMapsApiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" }
    },
    "android": {
      "config": { "googleMaps": { "apiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" } }
    },
    "extra": {
      "googleMapsApiKey": "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also provide the key at runtime by setting the `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
